//! `derivatives`: Calculate numerical derivatives of real data.
//!
//! This module provides two kinds of numeric derivatives:
//!
//! 1. Traditional numeric derivatives: [`first_order`] and [`nth_order`]. These are your typical
//!    "rise over run" derivatives.
//!    - Their implementations are also exposed in case you have advanced needs that might benefit
//!      from differentiating individual points: [`central_difference_derivative`],
//!      [`forward_difference_derivative`], and [`backward_difference_derivative`].
//! 2. Time-shifted derivatives: [`first_order_time_shifted`] and [`second_order_time_shifted`].
//!    These recognize that "rise over run" algorithms don't estimate the derivative at a point, but
//!    the derivative at the midpoint between it and another point, and does a little bit of
//!    trickery to adjust these to the start of intervals. Unfortunately, they lose the first and
//!    last items in the list.
//!    - Their implementations are also exposed in case you have advanced needs that might benefit
//!      from differentiating individual points: [`derivative_time_shifted`] and
//!      [`second_derivative_time_shifted`].
//!
//! For details on the math behind these algorithms, see the Typst document
//! `/docs/derivatives.typ`. It also provides a Taylor Series expansion of the traditional numeric
//! derivatives to provide a more formal depiction of how error works for them.
